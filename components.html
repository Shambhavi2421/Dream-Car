            <b>The rechargeable battery is the power source of the EV, and provides the fuel (electricity) to the electric motor. Any EV typically uses more than one battery, collectively referred to as a battery pack. Most EVs have these installed under the floor of the cabin. Their power capacity is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).</p></b>

            <h3 class="mot">Motors</h3>
            <div id="box1">
            <p><img src="motor.png" width="100" height="100" align="top" border="0"><br><br>
            <b>Electric motors replace the complex powertrains of conventional cars. There is typically one, but we have also seen dual motors and rarely three or four individual motors for each wheel. The motors are relatively compact and liberate more space in EVs. The electric motorsâ€™ advantage is immediate peak torque delivery, and noiseless, pollution-free operation.</b></p>

        <h3 class="con">Controller</h3>
        <div id="box2">
        <p><img src="controller.png" width="100" height="100" align="top" border="0"><br><br>
        <b>All that immediate torque may not always be needed, so an EV has a controller to regulate the flow of power from the battery pack to its motor. It computes your usage with respect to the available battery charge and delivers power accordingly. This also opens the EV up to various driving modes.</b></p>
